A game demo I abandoned in January 2006. I intended this to be an isometric game
where you drive around in a little tank and blow things up. Miraculously, it
still builds and runs in Visual Studio 2022.

# Controls

- `A` moves the right tread forwards.
- `Z` moves the right tread backwards.
- `S` moves the left tread forwards.
- `X` moves the left tread backwards.
- By moving both treads in the same direction you can go forwards or backwards.
- `ESC` exits the game.
